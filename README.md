## ‚ú®Project Overview

This Mole Day Project was created by Connor Denihan and Paul Savvas in 2025. It was designed for the Great Mills High School STEM academy's Mole Day Celebration. The project consists of two major sections: Hardware and Software. Both the Hardware and Software are publicly available under their respective licenses. The entirety of this chemistry has been nicknamed Mole Mini, running Mole OS as its software.

### üñ•Ô∏èSoftware
Mole OS is the software designed for Mole Mini.

‚ú®**Features**

- Chemical Equation Balancer: Input an unbalanced equation and within seconds received the balanced version.
- Frequency and Wavelength Calculator: A calculator that can find the speed of light, wavelength or frequency when two known values are inputted.
- Frequency and Photon Energy Calculator: A powerful tool than can help find either photon Energy, frequency or Planck's constant when two values are inputted.
- Mole Calculator: A simple tool to help determine the missing value between mass, molecular weight and moles.
